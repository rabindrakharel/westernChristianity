# Chapter 29 Training the Next Generation to Stay and Lead

Young people stay where they are trusted with meaningful responsibility and formed by credible adults.

Retention is not achieved through entertainment competition. It is achieved through apprenticeship, ownership, and mission.

Churches must move youth from consumers of ministry to co-laborers in ministry.

**Leadership practice:** Create multi-year apprenticeships where young leaders are mentored, evaluated, and released into visible responsibility.

## Big Idea
Retention improves when younger believers are trusted, coached, and deployed meaningfully.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 2 Timothy 2:2; Ephesians 4:12.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Create a multi-year apprenticeship track with mentors.
- Assign young leaders visible responsibility with feedback loops.
- Integrate vocation, theology, and mission coaching.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Tokenizing young leaders without authority.
- Expecting maturity without patient mentoring.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Where can young leaders carry real responsibility now?
2. Who is personally investing in their formation?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, raise and root the next generation of faithful leaders.
