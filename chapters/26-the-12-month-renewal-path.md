# Chapter 26 The 12-Month Renewal Path

Renewal requires sequencing. Churches often attempt too many changes too quickly and lose trust.

A sustainable 12-month path can follow four phases:
1. **Discernment (Months 1–3):** Prayer, diagnosis, listening, data gathering.
2. **Formation (Months 4–6):** Teaching, leader training, pilot practices.
3. **Activation (Months 7–9):** Congregation-wide implementation.
4. **Integration (Months 10–12):** Evaluation, testimony, adaptation.

Pacing change is pastoral wisdom, not lack of conviction.

## Big Idea
Vision without sequencing produces change fatigue and distrust.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Proverbs 21:5; Luke 14:28.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Publish a 12-month roadmap with milestones and owners.
- Set quarterly review checkpoints with transparent updates.
- Pair strategy documents with congregational prayer rhythms.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Launching too many changes simultaneously.
- Planning without pastoral pacing.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What must happen first, second, and third for renewal?
2. How will we communicate progress honestly?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
God of wisdom, give us patience and clarity in implementation.
