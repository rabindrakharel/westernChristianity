# Chapter 19 Simplicity as Prophetic Witness

Consumer culture trains Christians to evaluate church by preference satisfaction. Simplicity retrains desire toward presence, prayer, generosity, and attentiveness.

A simpler church is not a smaller vision church. It is a more focused church—less distracted by image and more available for people.

In a culture of excess, disciplined simplicity is missionary.

**Discipleship practice:** Introduce a seasonal simplicity liturgy (fasting, budget review, hospitality challenge, generosity goal).

## Big Idea
Consumer culture disciples believers into endless choice and low commitment.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 1 Timothy 6:6–10; Matthew 11:28–30.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Practice seasonal simplicity: fasting, spending review, generosity goals.
- Reduce production costs and redirect savings to mission.
- Teach Sabbath as resistance to anxious consumption.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Romanticizing minimalism while ignoring justice.
- Equating simplicity with austerity performance.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What unnecessary complexity is draining our mission?
2. How can simplicity increase availability for people?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Prince of peace, simplify our loves and free our hands to serve.
