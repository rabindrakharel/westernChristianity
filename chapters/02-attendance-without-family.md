# Chapter 2 Attendance Without Family

Many congregations measure health by attendance, volunteer rosters, budget stability, and event execution. These metrics may indicate activity, but activity is not maturity. In Scripture, church health is seen in mutual burden-bearing, reconciliation, generosity, and shared life.

A crowded sanctuary can hide deep isolation. People worship in proximity but live in disconnection. They know the liturgy but not one another’s grief. They hear sermons on love but do not have names, tables, or rhythms where that love is practiced.

Family language without family practice leads to spiritual cynicism. Especially for younger believers and newcomers, this gap feels dishonest.

**Pastoral move:** Conduct a fellowship audit: Who has eaten together this month? Who has been visited in crisis? Who has been absorbed into daily life, not just invited to events?

## Big Idea
Attendance may stabilize while mutual care declines; people can consume worship without becoming family.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 1 Corinthians 12:12–27; Galatians 6:2.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Create a care map tracking hospitalizations, bereavements, and crises with response teams.
- Move membership classes from information only to covenant and practice commitments.
- Pilot “shared table Sundays” after service for inter-household connection.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Measuring success only by room size.
- Assuming programs produce belonging automatically.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Where are people present but not integrated?
2. How do we define church health beyond attendance?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, make us one body, not an audience.
