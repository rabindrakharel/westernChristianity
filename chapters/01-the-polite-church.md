# Chapter 1 The Polite Church

Canadian churches are often kind, organized, and conflict-averse. These are not bad traits in themselves. Yet when civility becomes the highest value, discipleship quietly collapses into social maintenance. A church can be pleasant without being present, warm in tone but distant in practice.

Politeness can become a shield against inconvenience. We protect schedules, preserve routines, and avoid awkwardness. Over time, this creates a church culture where no one is actively rejected, but many are functionally unseen.

The gospel does not call us to hostility, but it does call us to holy interruption. Jesus was approachable to the overlooked, inconvenient to the powerful, and emotionally available to the suffering. If our gatherings are orderly but not incarnational, we are not being faithful—we are simply being efficient.

**Pastoral move:** Begin naming the difference between friendliness and fellowship. Ask leaders to identify who remains unknown month after month.

## Big Idea
Many congregations are socially warm on Sundays but relationally inaccessible during the week. Civility can hide loneliness.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Acts 2:42–47; John 13:34–35.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Train greeters to transition from hello to follow-up invitation.
- Assign every leader three people to intentionally know by name and story each month.
- Replace one announcement slot each week with a real testimony of shared-life care.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Confusing low conflict with spiritual health.
- Treating friendliness as a substitute for covenantal fellowship.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Who in our church can attend for months and remain unknown?
2. What current routines protect comfort more than people?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Jesus, move us from polite distance to embodied love.
