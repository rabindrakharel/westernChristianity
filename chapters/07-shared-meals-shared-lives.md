# Chapter 7 Shared Meals, Shared Lives

Meals are not sentimental extras; they are discipleship architecture. Around tables, strangers become neighbors, stories become known, and burdens become shareable.

A church that only gathers in rows will struggle to become family. A church that regularly gathers around meals creates social elasticity: room for difference, room for grief, room for delight.

Hospitality is not performance. It is offering ordinary life in the name of Christ.

**Formation practice:** Adopt a simple rhythm: each household hosts or participates in one shared meal rhythm every two weeks.

## Big Idea
Table fellowship has declined, yet meals remain one of the strongest bridges across class, age, and ethnicity.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Luke 24:30–35; Acts 2:46.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Launch rotating neighborhood supper groups of 8–10 people.
- Normalize simple meals over performance hosting.
- Add monthly “bring someone new” table nights.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Treating hospitality as personality-driven.
- Equating high production with meaningful welcome.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Who has not been invited into a home this quarter?
2. What would simple, repeatable hospitality look like here?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, turn our tables into places of healing and discipleship.
