# Chapter 18 Shared Risk, Shared Joy

Many congregations seek safety over faithfulness. Yet joy often grows where believers take risks together—opening homes, sponsoring newcomers, supporting families in crisis, and stepping into uncertain service.

Shared risk builds shared memory. Shared memory builds resilient community. Resilient community sustains long-term witness.

Sacrifice does not diminish the church’s joy; it purifies it.

**Discipleship practice:** Identify one annual congregational risk-project that requires broad participation and measurable sacrifice.

## Big Idea
Shared risk builds courage and trust that passive membership cannot produce.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Hebrews 10:24; Philippians 1:27–30.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Choose one annual congregation-wide sacrificial mission project.
- Create support structures for families taking major service risks.
- Celebrate faithfulness, not just outcomes, in public testimony.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Confusing risk with recklessness.
- Leaving sacrificial burdens on a small faithful minority.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What risks has God already put in front of us?
2. How do we carry risk together rather than alone?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, make us brave together for the sake of love.
