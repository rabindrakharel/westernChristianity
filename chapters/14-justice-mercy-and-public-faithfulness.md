# Chapter 14 Justice, Mercy, and Public Faithfulness

Justice and mercy are not optional emphases for specialized ministries. They are central features of biblical fidelity.

Public faithfulness means churches are known for tangible care: legal support for newcomers, mentoring for youth, accompaniment for single parents, employment pathways for vulnerable neighbors, and advocacy when systems fail.

Mercy without justice can become temporary relief; justice without mercy can become ideological performance. The gospel requires both.

**Missional practice:** Build a mercy-and-justice team with clear local objectives, annual goals, and testimony rhythms.

## Big Idea
Communities notice when churches preach mercy but remain absent in structural hardship.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Isaiah 58:6–12; James 2:14–17.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Launch legal aid and job-readiness clinics with trusted partners.
- Develop care pathways for single parents and isolated seniors.
- Publish yearly justice-and-mercy impact goals.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Choosing symbolic statements over sustained service.
- Treating justice and mercy as competing camps.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Where do people in our city fall through the cracks?
2. How can we embody both mercy and justice together?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
God of justice, make our mercy tangible and our convictions credible.
