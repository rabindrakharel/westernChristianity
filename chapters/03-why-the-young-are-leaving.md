# Chapter 3 Why the Young Are Leaving

Young adults are often described as distracted, skeptical, or overly influenced by secular culture. These factors matter, but they are not the whole story. Many are leaving because what they see in church does not match what they read in Scripture.

This generation can detect image management. They are less impressed by polished production and more interested in coherence: Does this community love enemies? Share resources? Cross boundaries? Make room for difference? Admit failure?

When church life appears low-cost and emotionally guarded, young people do not always rebel loudly—they drift quietly. They look for meaning where sacrifice, solidarity, and collaboration are visible.

**Pastoral move:** Invite young adults into decision-making, mission design, and testimony spaces where they can name what feels performative and what feels real.

## Big Idea
Young adults often leave quietly when they experience inconsistency between preaching and practice.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Joel 2:28; 1 Timothy 4:12.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Form a youth advisory circle with direct access to elders.
- Invite young adults to co-lead mission projects, not just youth events.
- Host quarterly “ask anything” forums with pastors and mentors.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Interpreting honest questions as rebellion.
- Offering platform style without relational apprenticeship.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What would make a skeptical young adult say “this is real”?
2. Where are we asking young people to spectate instead of serve?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Spirit of God, give the next generation a faith they can inhabit fully.
