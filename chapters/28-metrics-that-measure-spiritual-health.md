# Chapter 28 Metrics That Measure Spiritual Health

Attendance still matters, but it cannot be the dominant metric. Churches need indicators that track formation and witness.

Suggested metrics:
- Newcomer integration within 60 days
- Frequency of shared meals and member care actions
- Participation in neighborhood mission
- Diversity in leadership pipelines
- Testimonies of reconciliation and sacrificial service

Metrics should illuminate discipleship, not replace it.

## Big Idea
Churches measure what they value; weak metrics can reward activity without formation.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: John 15:8; Philippians 1:9–11.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Adopt a balanced scorecard: belonging, mission, sacrifice, reconciliation.
- Collect both quantitative and testimony-based evidence.
- Review indicators publicly to foster shared accountability.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Reducing discipleship to numbers alone.
- Avoiding measurement because it feels unspiritual.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Do our metrics reflect the fruit we actually desire?
2. What stories prove transformation beyond attendance?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, teach us to measure fruit that matters to You.
