# Chapter 20 The Cross and the Canadian Imagination

Canadian public life often prizes moderation, privacy, and non-disruption. These traits can support civic peace, but they can also domesticate discipleship when treated as ultimate values.

The cross forms a different imagination: public faithfulness, costly love, and moral courage with gentleness. Christians need not become combative to become courageous.

A mature church can be both peaceable and prophetic.

**Discipleship practice:** Train leaders to address contested issues with biblical clarity, pastoral warmth, and relational courage.

## Big Idea
Canadian norms of privacy and moderation can soften prophetic courage when left unchallenged.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 1 Corinthians 1:18–25; Matthew 5:9–16.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Train leaders for courageous-and-gentle public communication.
- Host forums on difficult issues with pastoral moderation.
- Develop response guides for cultural flashpoints rooted in Scripture.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Becoming combative in the name of courage.
- Becoming silent in the name of peace.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Where are we avoiding truth to preserve comfort?
2. How can we be peaceable and prophetic at once?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Jesus, form in us courage without contempt.
