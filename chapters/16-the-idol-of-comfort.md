# Chapter 16 The Idol of Comfort

Comfort is a gift when received with gratitude. Comfort becomes an idol when preserved at the expense of obedience.

Church decline often tracks not persecution but accommodation. We avoid inconvenience, protect preferences, and reinterpret discipleship to fit manageable lifestyles.

The cross confronts this drift. Jesus does not call us to minimal disruption but to surrendered allegiance.

**Discipleship practice:** Teach annually on comfort-idolatry with concrete calls to sacrifice time, status, and convenience.

## Big Idea
Comfort has become a default discipleship value in many congregations.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Luke 9:23–25; Revelation 3:17.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Teach a yearly “cross-shaped life” series with concrete challenges.
- Invite members into a 30-day discomfort-for-love practice.
- Share testimonies of costly obedience in worship.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Spiritualizing convenience as wisdom.
- Admiring sacrifice in theory but resisting it in practice.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What comforts are shaping our obedience boundaries?
2. Where is Jesus inviting us into costly love now?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Crucified Lord, free us from comfort-idolatry.
