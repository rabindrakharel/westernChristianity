# Chapter 15 Evangelism Through Credible Community

In many Canadian contexts, people distrust institutions but remain open to authentic relationships. Evangelism regains credibility when proclamation is embodied by communities marked by humility, reconciliation, and generosity.

The church’s life together is part of its message. Where unity crosses social boundaries, the gospel becomes plausible. Where relationships mirror social fragmentation, the message is contradicted.

Evangelism is not less than verbal witness—but it is never less than visible love.

**Missional practice:** Integrate testimony and invitation into every service context, connecting gospel claims to shared-life evidence.

## Big Idea
In a post-trust culture, shared-life credibility often opens the door for verbal gospel witness.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 1 Peter 3:15–16; John 17:20–23.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Train members to share testimony in 3-minute and 10-minute formats.
- Integrate invitation moments into service initiatives.
- Coach leaders to connect doctrine with lived community practices.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Separating proclamation from embodied love.
- Avoiding invitation because of fear of offense.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What makes our evangelism believable to outsiders?
2. Where are we withholding clear invitation to Jesus?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, let our words and life announce the same gospel.
