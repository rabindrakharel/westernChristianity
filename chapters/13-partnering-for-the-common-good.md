# Chapter 13 Partnering for the Common Good

Partnership with civic organizations can deepen mission when done with clarity. Churches need not choose between gospel proclamation and social service. Biblical witness includes word and deed.

Healthy partnerships require theological confidence and practical humility. We collaborate where possible, maintain conviction where needed, and refuse both sectarian withdrawal and identity dilution.

Partnership is not compromise when Christlike love remains explicit.

**Missional practice:** Create a partnership covenant defining scope, values, and witness posture for each external collaboration.

## Big Idea
Partnership is necessary in complex cities, but collaboration without clarity can blur witness.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Micah 6:8; Philippians 2:3–4.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Draft a partnership covenant for doctrine, scope, and communication.
- Assign liaison leaders to maintain trust with external partners.
- Debrief partnership outcomes with spiritual discernment.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Partnering without theological boundaries.
- Rejecting collaboration out of fear.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What can we do better with others than alone?
2. How do we keep Christ explicit while serving common good?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, grant us humility to collaborate and courage to remain clear.
