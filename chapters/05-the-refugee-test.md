# Chapter 5 The Refugee Test

A church’s theology is tested by its response to the vulnerable. Refugees, immigrants, widows, single parents, and socially isolated newcomers reveal whether our ecclesiology is embodied or theoretical.

Hospitality is not an accessory ministry. It is a theological announcement: God welcomed us while we were strangers. To remain socially closed while doctrinally orthodox is a contradiction the New Testament does not permit.

The refugee test is not about politics. It is about proximity. Who is invited to table? Who receives practical care? Who is accompanied through bureaucracy, language barriers, and loneliness?

**Pastoral move:** Establish a newcomer pathway that includes sponsorship, home meals, language support, and long-term relational accompaniment.

## Big Idea
Refugees and newcomers expose whether hospitality is theology in action or only a sermon theme.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Leviticus 19:33–34; Matthew 25:35.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Create a newcomer team for housing, language, and systems navigation.
- Pair newcomer households with host families for six months.
- Build legal, employment, and school referral partnerships.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Reducing hospitality to a one-time welcome event.
- Politicizing strangers instead of pastoring persons.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Who walks into our church and remains unseen?
2. What barriers make belonging hardest for newcomers?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
God of welcome, teach us to receive the stranger as neighbor.
