# Chapter 17 Time, Money, and Mission

Spiritual priorities are revealed by calendars and budgets. If mission, hospitality, and mercy are peripheral in both personal and church spending, vision statements ring hollow.

Sacrificial revival requires reallocation, not merely inspiration. Churches must budget for people before polish, formation before expansion, mercy before optics.

Generosity is not fundraising pressure; it is discipleship formation.

**Discipleship practice:** Publish a transparent mission budget and invite members to align household spending with kingdom commitments.

## Big Idea
Budgets and calendars reveal true priorities more clearly than mission slogans.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Matthew 6:19–21; 2 Corinthians 8:1–7.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Align annual budgeting with discipleship and mercy priorities first.
- Teach household stewardship cohorts for generosity formation.
- Report financial impact in story-and-data format quarterly.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Treating generosity as emergency fundraising.
- Hiding financial decisions from congregational accountability.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Does our spending match our stated mission?
2. How are we discipling people economically, not only devotionally?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Provider God, reorder our resources for Your kingdom.
