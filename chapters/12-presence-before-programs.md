# Chapter 12 Presence Before Programs

Churches often respond to decline by launching more programs. Programs can help, but without relational presence they become event machinery.

People are not transformed by activity volume. They are transformed by trustworthy relationships over time.

A smaller number of well-led, relationally thick initiatives often bears more fruit than constant event expansion.

**Missional practice:** Cancel low-fruit events and reallocate energy toward consistent neighborhood presence.

## Big Idea
Program growth can hide relational thinness when people are busy but unknown.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: John 1:14; 1 Thessalonians 2:8.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Audit ministries for relational depth, then simplify ruthlessly.
- Protect margin for pastoral conversations before and after services.
- Prioritize fewer initiatives with deeper follow-through.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Adding events to solve spiritual shallowness.
- Mistaking operational excellence for transformation.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Which ministries produce depth, and which produce noise?
2. Where do we need to prune for faithfulness?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Incarnate Christ, teach us presence over performance.
