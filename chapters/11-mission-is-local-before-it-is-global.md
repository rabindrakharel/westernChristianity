# Chapter 11 Mission Is Local Before It Is Global

Global mission matters deeply, but many churches bypass their own streets. Biblical mission begins where we already are: apartment buildings, schools, workplaces, campuses, and neighborhoods.

When local mission is neglected, faith becomes abstract. When local mission is embraced, theology becomes visible.

Mission starts with attention: Who is lonely? Who is under pressure? Who is newly arrived? Who is one crisis away from collapse?

**Missional practice:** Every ministry team adopts one local context (school, shelter, newcomer center, housing complex) for long-term presence.

## Big Idea
Churches often celebrate global mission while under-engaging the blocks around their buildings.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Luke 10:1–9; Acts 1:8.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Map your parish: schools, shelters, apartments, and social services.
- Assign each ministry a local mission focus.
- Hold monthly neighborhood prayer walks with listening posture.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Outsourcing local mission to a small volunteer subgroup.
- Equating mission only with events.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Who are our nearest neighbors in greatest vulnerability?
2. What does sustained local presence require from us?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Send us, Lord, to the people already near us.
