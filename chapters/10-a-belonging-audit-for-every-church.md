# Chapter 10 A Belonging Audit for Every Church

Good intentions do not automatically produce belonging. Churches need practical diagnostics.

A belonging audit should ask:
- Are newcomers known by name within two weeks?
- Are isolated members connected to households and small groups?
- Are practical needs addressed quickly and personally?
- Do members report feeling seen, needed, and loved?

Measurement should serve formation, not bureaucracy. The goal is not data collection; the goal is relational repair.

**Formation practice:** Run quarterly audits with testimonies, not just numbers.

## Big Idea
Belonging must be measured intentionally or drift goes unnoticed until people disappear.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: 2 Corinthians 13:5; Hebrews 10:24–25.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Run quarterly belonging surveys plus pastoral interviews.
- Track first-90-day newcomer integration milestones.
- Publish a care dashboard with stories and next actions.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Using data as control instead of care.
- Collecting numbers without accountability.

## Discussion Prompts
1. What metrics reveal real fellowship, not activity?
2. How do we close the loop after we identify gaps?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, give us honest measures that lead to love.
