# Chapter 6 From Audience to Body

Modern church culture often forms spectators: people who consume teaching while outsourcing care to staff. The New Testament forms participants: members of one body who share responsibility for one another’s growth.

The image of the body implies interdependence. No member is unnecessary, no pain is private, no gift exists for personal branding alone.

Relational revival begins when churches redefine maturity from private devotion to mutual responsibility.

**Formation practice:** Teach membership as covenant participation with concrete commitments: presence, care, confession, peacemaking, and mission.

## Big Idea
Consumer habits shape church expectations: watch, rate, and leave rather than contribute and grow.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Ephesians 4:11–16; Romans 12:4–8.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Teach spiritual gifts with immediate serving pathways.
- Reframe ministry teams as formation communities, not staffing pipelines.
- Ask every member to own one burden and one mission responsibility.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Centralizing all care in paid staff.
- Celebrating charisma over character and faithfulness.

## Discussion Prompts
1. How are we training participants, not spectators?
2. What gifts remain dormant in our congregation?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Christ our head, mature us into a functioning body.
