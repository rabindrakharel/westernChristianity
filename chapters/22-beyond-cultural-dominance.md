# Chapter 22 Beyond Cultural Dominance

Every church has a culture. Problems emerge when one cultural style is treated as spiritually normative for everyone.

Dominance often appears subtly—whose music is central, whose communication style sets the tone, whose stories are platformed, whose leadership pathways are accessible.

Humble revival asks not, “Is our culture bad?” but, “Have we mistaken our culture for the gospel?”

**Humble practice:** Conduct a cultural power audit across worship, leadership, decision-making, and social life.

## Big Idea
Cultural dominance in church can be subtle yet deeply formative for belonging.

## Biblical Anchor
- Primary texts: Galatians 3:28; Romans 15:7.
- Ministry implication: this chapter calls the church to visible obedience, not conceptual agreement.

## Canadian Reality Check
In many communities, this issue is shaped by urban diversity, suburban mobility, rural isolation, and generational transition. Churches that face this reality with humility and courage become more credible to neighbors and more formative for disciples.

## Ministry Experiments (Start Small)
- Audit platform representation and leadership pathways.
- Adapt worship, communication, and hospitality for cultural breadth.
- Create shared leadership cohorts across cultural backgrounds.

## Leadership Pitfalls to Avoid
- Token diversity without shared authority.
- Defensiveness when cultural blind spots are named.

## Discussion Prompts
1. Whose norms are assumed to be “normal” here?
2. Where does power need to be shared, not just symbolized?
3. What is one concrete change we will begin this month, and who owns it?

## Prayer
Lord, dethrone our cultural pride and teach us mutual honor.
